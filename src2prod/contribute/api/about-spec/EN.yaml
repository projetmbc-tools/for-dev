  name*   : This allows you to give the name of the distributed product
            instead of the name automatically generated from the name of
            the folder containing this YAML file (in some cases, product
            names must follow specific naming rules).

  acronym*: Most names follow hidden schemas that you can explain here.
            For example, you can just type "MY Hidden Acronym" for
            a product named is ''myha''.

  desc    : You must always give one small description of your product,
            or monorepo.

  readme*: |
           By default, a ''readme'' folder is searched first, and then
           a ''README.md'' file in the project folder, and not its
           source directory, but you can use two kinds of path for
           the ''README'' file of the product.
             1) ''path/to/file/README.md'' indicates an existing file.
             2) ''path/to/dir/readme/'' allows to use a directory following
               the specifications of the Python project ''multimd'' such
               as to write the ''README'' file part by part.

  url:
    repo*: The url of the product repository.
    home*: The url of a dedicated website for the product.
    doc* : The url of a dedicated website for the product documentation.

  lang*:
    readme*: This indicates the language(s) of the ''README'' file(s) which
             can be given as a single language ID like ''fr'' or ''en''
             for example, or as a comma separated list of IDs like
             ''fr, en, es''.

    doc*:
      manual*: See the specifications above for the ''README'' file.
      code*  : See the specifications above for the ''README'' file.

  licence*: |
            There is two ways to give the licence of the product.
              1) You can use an ID managed by the Python project ''ealic''.
              2) You can give the path of one file containing the full
                 text of the licence like in ''path/to/my/licence.txt
                 [My special licence]'' where we also have to indicate
                 the name of the licence inside square brackets.
